## Abstract

A proposal for a tokenized reserve mechanism. The reserve allows an audit of on-chain actions of the owner. Using [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md), stakeholders can create shares to show support for actions in the reserve.

## Motivation

Tokenized reserves are an extension of tokenized vaults. The goal is to create a reserve similar to a real world reserve an entity has as a backup in case regular funds run low. In the real world, an entity will have to meet certain criteria before accessing reserve funds. In a decentralized environment, an entity can incorporate stakeholders into their criteria. This will help entities who participate in decentralized environments to be transparent with stakeholders.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Definitions:

	- owner: The creator of the reserve
	- user: Stakeholders of specific proposals
	- reserve: The tokenized reserve contract
	- proposal: Occurs when the owner wants a withdrawal from contract
 
### Constructor:
 
 	- name: ERC-20 token name
  	- ticker: ERC-20 ticker
   	- asset: ERC-4626 underlying ERC-20 address
	- rAuth: Primary authorized user
	- rOwner: Owner of the Reserve

## Rationale

This proposal is designed to be a basic implementation of a reserve fund interface. Other non specified conditions should be addressed on a case by case basis. Each reserve uses [ERC-20](../EIPS/eip-20.md) standard for shares, and [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md) for the creation of shares. The reserve token can be the underlying token in [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md) or the shares that are created when the underlying token is deposited in the vault. 
[ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md) is implemented to the reserve to account for user participation. There needs to be a representation for users participating in a proposal within a reserve. With vaults, the implementor could decide how to treat participation based on users entering the vault. For example, a user could be forced not to use the same tokens in multiple proposals to allow shares to be created fairly. Once the underlying token is deposited into the vault for an open proposal those tokens could not be accessible until the proposal is closed. 
It is not explicitly enforced that deposited tokens that create shares cannot be withdrawn by the owner of the reserve. On a case by case basis there can be implementions to ensure those tokens are accounted for if needed.  

## Backwards Compatibility

Tokenized reserves are made compatible with [ERC-20](../EIPS/eip-20.md) and [ERC-4626](../EIPS/eip-4626.md).
