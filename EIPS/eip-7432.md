## Abstract

This standard introduces role management for NFTs. Each role assignment is associated with a single NFT and expires
automatically at a given timestamp. Roles are defined as `bytes32` and feature a custom `_data` field of arbitrary size
to allow customization.

## Motivation

The NFT Roles interface aims to establish a standard for role management in NFTs. Tracking on-chain roles enables
decentralized applications (dApps) to implement access control for privileged actions, e.g., minting tokens with a role
(airdrop claim rights).

NFT roles can be deeply integrated with dApps to create a utility-sharing mechanism. A good example is in digital real
estate. A user can create a digital property NFT and grant a `keccak256("PROPERTY_MANAGER")` role to another user,
allowing them to delegate specific utility without compromising ownership. The same user could also grant multiple
`keccak256("PROPERTY_TENANT")` roles, allowing the grantees to access and interact with the digital property.

There are also interesting use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi). Insurance policies could be issued as NFTs, and 
the beneficiaries, insured, and insurer could all be on-chain roles tracked using this standard.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 and RFC-8174.

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following interface:

### Metadata Extension

The Roles Metadata extension extends the traditional JSON-based metadata schema of NFTs. Therefore, DApps supporting
this feature MUST also implement the metadata extension of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). This
extension is **optional** and allows developers to provide additional information for roles.

Updated Metadata Schema:

```js
{
  
  /** Existing NFT Metadata **/

  "title": "Asset Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive"
    }
  },
  
  /** Additional fields for Roles **/

  "roles": [
    {
      "id": {
        "type": "bytes32",
        "description": "Identifies the role"
      },
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Human-readable name of the role"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Describes the role"
      },
      "isUniqueRole": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "description": "Whether the role supports simultaneous assignments or not"
      },
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Human-readable name of the argument"
          },
          "type": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Solidity type, e.g., uint256 or address"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  
}
```

The following JSON is an example of [ERC-7432](./eip-7432.md) Metadata:

```js
{
  // ... Existing NFT Metadata
  
  "roles": [
    {
      // keccak256("PROPERTY_MANAGER")
      "id": "0x5cefc88e2d50f91b66109b6bb76803f11168ca3d1cee10cbafe864e4749970c7",
      "name": "Property Manager",
      "description": "The manager of the property is responsible for furnishing it and ensuring its good condition.",
      "isUniqueRole": false,
      "inputs": []
    },
    {
      // keccak256("PROPERTY_TENANT")
      "id": "0x06a3b33b0a800805559ee9c64f55afd8a43a05f8472feb6f6b77484ff5ac9c26",
      "name": "Property Tenant",
      "description": "The tenant of the property is responsible for paying the rent and keeping the property in good condition.",
      "isUniqueRole": true,
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "rent",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  
}
```

The `roles` array properties are SUGGESTED, and developers should add any other relevant information as necessary (e.g.,
an image for the role). However, it's highly RECOMMENDED to include the `isUniqueRole` property, as this field is
used to determine if the `hasRole` or `hasUniqueRole` function should be called (refer to 
[Unique and Non-Unique Roles](#unique-and-non-unique-roles)).

It's also important to highlight the importance of the `inputs` property. This field describes the parameters that
should be encoded and passed to the `grantRole` function. It's RECOMMENDED to use the properties `type` and `components`
defined on the Solidity ABI Specification, where `type` is the canonical type of the parameter, and `components` is used
for complex tuple types.

### Caveats

* Compliant contracts MUST implement the `IERC7432` interface.
* A role is represented by a `bytes32`, and it's RECOMMENDED to use the `keccak256` of the role's name for this purpose:
  `bytes32 role = keccak256("ROLE_NAME")`.
* The `grantRole` function MUST revert if the `_expirationDate` is in the past, and MAY be implemented as `public` or
  `external`.
* The `grantRoleFrom` function MUST revert if the `_expirationDate` is in the past or if the `msg.sender` is not approved
  to grant roles on behalf of the `_grantor`. It MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `revokeRole` and `revokeRoleFrom` functions SHOULD revert if `_revocable` is `false`. They MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `revokeRoleFrom` function MUST revert if the `msg.sender` is not approved to revoke roles on behalf of the `_revoker` or the `_grantee`.
  It MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `setRoleApprovalForAll` function MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `approveRole` function MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `hasRole` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view` and SHOULD only confirm if the role assignment exists
  and is not expired (supports simultaneous role assignments).
* The `hasUniqueRole` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view` and SHOULD check if the assignment exists, is not
  expired and is the last one granted (does not support simultaneous role assignments).
* The `roleData` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and SHOULD return an empty array of bytes if the role
  assignment does not exist.
* The `roleExpirationDate` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and SHOULD return zero if the role
  assignment does not exist.
* The `isRoleApprovedForAll` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view` and SHOULD only return `true` if the
  `_operator` is approved to grant and revoke roles for all NFTs on behalf of the `_grantor`.
* The `getApprovedRole` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view` and SHOULD only return `true` if the `_operator`
  is approved to grant and revoke roles for the specified NFT on behalf of the `_grantor`.
* Compliant contracts SHOULD support [ERC-165](./eip-165.md).

## Rationale

[ERC-7432](./eip-7432.md) IS NOT an extension of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). The main reason
behind this decision is to keep the standard agnostic of any NFT implementation. This approach also enables the standard
to be implemented externally or on the same contract as the NFT, and allow dApps to use roles with immutable NFTs.

### Automatic Expiration

Automatic expiration is implemented via the `grantRole` and `hasRole` functions. `grantRole` is responsible for setting
the expiration date, and `hasRole` checks if the role is expired by comparing with the current block timestamp
(`block.timestamp`). Since `uint256` is not natively supported by most programming languages, dates are represented as
`uint64` on this standard. The maximum UNIX timestamp represented by a `uint64` is about the year `584,942,417,355`,
which should be enough to be considered "permanent". For this reason, it's RECOMMENDED using `type(uint64).max` when
calling the `grantRole` function to support use cases that require an assignment never to expire. 

### Revocable Roles

In certain scenarios, the grantor may need to revoke a role before its expiration date, while in others, the grantee
requires assurance that the grantor cannot revoke the role. The `_revocable` parameter was introduced to the `grantRole`
function to support both use cases and specify whether the `grantor` can revoke assigned roles.

Regardless of the value of `_revocable`, it's RECOMMENDED always to enable the `grantee` to revoke received roles,
allowing recipients to eliminate undesirable assignments.

### Unique and Non-Unique Roles

The standard supports both unique and non-unique roles. Unique roles can be assigned to only one account at a time,
while non-unique roles can be granted to multiple accounts simultaneously. The roles extension metadata can be used to
specify if roles are unique or not, and if the contract does not implement it, all roles should be considered
non-unique.

To verify the validity of a unique role, dApps SHOULD use the `hasUniqueRole` function, which also checks if no other
assignment was granted afterward. In other words, for unique roles, each new assignment invalidates the previous one,
and only the last one can be valid.

### Custom Data

DApps can customize roles using the `_data` parameter of the `grantRole` function. `_data`  is implemented using the
generic type `bytes` to enable dApps to encode any role-specific information when creating a role assignment. The custom
data is retrievable using the `roleData` function and is emitted with the `RoleGranted` event. With this approach, 
developers can integrate this information into their applications, both on-chain and off-chain.

### Role Approval

Similar to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), this standard enables users to approve other accounts to grant and revoke roles on
its behalf. Users can authorize an account to manage a single NFT or any NFTs in a collection. This functionality was
introduced to allow third-party contracts to interact with ERC-7432 without requiring ownership of the NFTs.

## Backwards Compatibility

On all functions and events, the standard requires both the `tokenAddress` and `tokenId` to be provided. This 
requirement enables dApps to use a standalone [ERC-7432](./eip-7432.md) contract as the authoritative source for the
roles of immutable NFTs. It also helps with backward compatibility as NFT-specific functions such as `ownerOf` and
`balanceOf` aren't required. Consequently, this design ensures a more straightforward integration with different
implementations of NFTs.

## Reference Implementation

See [ERC-7432.sol](../assets/eip-7432/ERC7432.sol).

## Security Considerations

Developers integrating the Non-Fungible Token Roles interface should consider the following on their implementations:

* Ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized role assignments or revocations.
* Take into account potential attack vectors such as reentrancy and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.
* Since this standard does not check NFT ownership, it's the responsibility of the dApp to query for the NFT Owner and
  pass the correct `_grantor` to the `hasRole` function.
* It's the responsibility of the dApp to check if the role is unique or non-unique. To ensure the role was not assigned
  to another account when unique, `hasUniqueRole` should be called instead of `hasRole`.
